# HTTP Introduction

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an important part of how the web works. 

HTTP ensures that the flow of information from client (often the browser) to the server and back runs smoothly.

It runs on top of other protocols, but in this introduction we will take all this for granted and focus on the HTTP layer.

### Exercise 1

Load the 'I Love Jigsaws' website with the Google Developer Tools network panel open

- Can you see the HTTP method?
- Can you see the Protocol?
- Can you see the type?
- Inspect some headers - find out more about at least one of the key/value pairs

Extension:

- Can you see the status code? - what are status codes? what other status codes are there?
- Explore the network panel - what else can you find out?

### Exercise 2

Load a website of your choice

- Explore the network panel - what can you find out about the HTTP requests needed to load your chosen website?
- What types of HTTP requests can you see?
- Can you trigger a POST request? (on this site or another one?)

TIP (You can choose to display only certain types of resource and/or only certain types of HTTP request)
